# Dataset Tag Editor

[日本語 Readme](README-JP.md)

This is an extension to edit captions in training dataset for [Stable Diffusion web UI by AUTOMATIC1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui).

It works well with text captions in comma-separated style (such as the tags generated by DeepBooru interrogator).

Caption in the filenames of images can be loaded, but edited captions can only be saved in the form of text files.

## By the way, how can I edit tags quickly?

Basic workflow is as follows:
1. Filter images
1. Batch edit  
  Please note that all batch editing will be applyed **only to displayed images (=filtered images)**.

### 1. Which filter is appropriate?
- **I want to edit all at once**  
  No filter is required.
- **Some images require editing**  
  1. **They should / shouldn't already have a same tag**  
    Go to "Filter by Tags" so that the only images to be edited are displayed.
  1. **They have nothing in common**  
    Go to "Filter by Selection" and apply.  
    Images can also be added to the filter by pushing [Enter] key.

### 2. How can I edit as I want?
- **I want to add some new tags**
  1. Go to "Batch Edit Captions" tab
  1. Append tags to "Edit tags" textbox
  1. Push "Apply changes to filtered images" button  
  ![](pic/ss08.png)  
  "foo" and "bar" will be added to all images displayed.

- **I want to replace the tags which are common to displayed images**
  1. Go to "Batch Edit Captions" tab
  1. Append tags to "Edit tags" textbox
  1. Push "Apply changes to filtered images" button  
  ![](pic/ss09.png)  
  "male focus" and "solo" will be replaced with "foo" and "bar".

- **I want to replace tags more flexibly**
  1. Go to "Batch Edit Captions" tab
  2. Use "Search and Replace" with "Use regex" checked  
  ![](pic/ss10.png)  
  "1boy", "2boys", … will be replaced with "1girl", "2girls", … in each tags of images displayed.

- **I want to remove some tags**  
  The same as replacing. Just replace the tags with "blank".  
  Also you can use "Remove" tab in "Batch Edit Captions".
